Prediction Framework for Peptide Ion-Mobilities

```ionmob``` is a python package for predicting collisional cross section - **CCS** - values of peptides.
It not only comes with several pretrained regression models for this task but also introduces a full pipeline to link data preprocessing, model training and ccs value inference.

### What is a peptide CCS value?
A scalar value that describes 

### Why would I want to predict CCS values of peptides in silico?
Recently, there has been renewed interest in possibilities that open up to 

### I am NOT a machine learning expert, can I still use ```ionmob```?
Definetly yes! We implemented a set of high-level, easy to use tools that make an in silico prediction with pretrained models easily integratable into your proteomics workflows.
All you need is a little bit of python scripting experience.

### I AM a machine learning expert/experienced coder, what is in it for me?
We made sure 

### Will there be a web interface for prediction?
