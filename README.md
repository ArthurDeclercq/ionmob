Prediction Framework for Peptide Ion-Mobilities

```ionmob``` is a python package for predicting collisional cross section - **CCS** - values of peptides.
It not only comes with several different regression tools for this task but also introduces a full pipeline to chain together data preprocessing, model training and ccs value inference.

### Why would I want to predict CCS values of peptides?
Recently, there has been renewed interest in possibilities to get information 

### I am not a machine learning expert, can I still use ```ionmob```?
